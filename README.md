# C# Projects - Portfolio

This repository showcases several projects developed using C# and .NET. Each project highlights specific programming principles such as object-oriented design, interface implementation, operator overloading, and polymorphism.

## Project List

### 1. Polymorphism.cs
- **Overview**: This project illustrates the use of polymorphism in C#. The `Employee` class implements the `IQuittable` interface, which includes a `Quit()` method. Within the main application, an `Employee` instance is referenced as an `IQuittable` object to demonstrate runtime polymorphism.
- **Core Concepts**: Polymorphism, Interfaces, Method Overriding.
- **Repository**: [Polymorphism Assignment](https://github.com/MehmetCifcii/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission)

### 2. Operator Assignment.cs
- **Overview**: Focused on operator overloading, this project defines custom behavior for `==` and `!=` operators in the `Employee` class to compare objects by their `Id`. It also includes overrides for the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods to ensure consistent comparison logic.
- **Core Concepts**: Operator Overloading, Overriding Base Methods.
- **Repository**: [Operators Assignment](https://github.com/MehmetCifcii/Operators-Assignment-Submission)

## Running the Projects
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and execute each project individually to test their functionality.
